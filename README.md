BCS-NeRF: Bundle Cross-Sensing Neural Radiance Fields
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have made significant progress in the field of novel view synthesis. However, it faces challenges when handling sparse images. In this paper, we propose Bundle Cross-Sensing Neural Radiance Fields (BCS-NeRF), a generalized neural rendering method for sparse input conditions. The core concepts of this method are as follows: First, the Bundle Feature Extraction Module is proposed and is utilized to compute multi-scale bundled convolutional features; Second, the convolutional features are refined using a Hybrid Cross-Perception Mechanism, aggregating cross-view interaction information to balance local and global features; Third, leveraging the cosine similarity as a cue for explicit matching, we conduct similarity embedding volume rendering; Finally, a novel regularization loss function is proposed, which mitigates the effects of shadows and blurred textures in scenarios with large-scale spans and limited feature information. Our method has been tested on several open-source datasets, and the experimental results consistently outperformed the state-of-the-art methods.
